# smartIflow Pressure Tank System
Seminar Paper "[Evaluation of the smartIflow approach to model-based safety analysis](./paper.pdf)" i wrote for the Lecture "Selected Topics of Intelligent Systems" in my Master's degree in Intelligent Systems at the University of Applied Sciences Ulm.

> Abstract: Safety Analysis, the verification of system designs, is a task that can be of critical importance. Traditional approaches such as Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) are reaching their limits due to growing system complexity. The more recent model-based approaches to safety analysis seem to have fewer problems with complexity due to the use of automated model checking techniques. One approach to model-based safety analysis is smartIflow [1]. In this paper, the smartIflow approach is evaluated based on the pressure tank system design, as it is described in the Fault Tree Handbook [2]. Part of this evaluation is the examination of the generated FTA and FMEA results. Further, it will be described how an explosion of the state space affects different analysis tasks, and how it can be mitigated by the means of smartIflow
